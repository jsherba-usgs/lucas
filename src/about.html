            The USGS is involved in a variety of scenario-based modeling projects aimed at projecting land-use change into the future. Typically, these projects lead to the creation of many time-series datasets in the form of large tabular and spatial files. A common difficulty among land-use scenario researchers is efficiently managing, analyzing, and visualizing these datasets.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <a href="http://gif.berkeley.edu/" target="blank">Geospatial Innovation Facility</a> (GIF) at University of California, Berkeley has developed a prototype web application designed to ingest the tabular and spatial data stored within a generalized USGS land-use database that manages modeling results from <a href="http://www.apexrms.com/" target="blank">ApexRMS</a>'s <a href="http://syncrosim.com" target="blank">SyncroSim</a> software. The prototype web application consists of the following components:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A public <a href="http://stage.landcarbon.org/api/">Application Programming Interface</a> (API) built on the <a href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org/">Django REST framework</a>. The API provides standardized access to data within the SyncroSim database for building web applications and data visualizations.
            </li>
            <li>
              A data management console for researchers to manage projects and scenarios.
            </li>
            <li>
              Interactive web based data visualizations built using the API that allow users to dynamically visualize dense time series of projected climate and land use futures.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
            This prototype web application allows researchers to explore land-use data scenarios and quickly share land-use modeling results with colleagues and  the public. The interactive data visualizations presented here and new tools built using the API can be used to communicate complex data and introduce non-scientists to the concept of scenarios, thus successfully fulfilling the USGS mandate of sharing datasets and science with the public.
